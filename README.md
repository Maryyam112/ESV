# ESV
This project's actual concept is to automatically suggest user-preferred videos based on emotion detection and sentiment analysis. In the existing system, users have to select the videos manually. Randomly played videos may not match the mood of the user. Users have to classify the videos into various emotions for playing the videos. By using the ESV system, these difficulties can no longer take place. The ESV system will use a deep learning technique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for emotion detection. CNN is used to solve classification or identification problems. For feedback, the ESV system will use a sentiment analysis algorithm. As reviews only rank the app or product. But with sentiment analysis, we will suggest the best-recommended videos to our customers as sentiment analysis helps us understand a sneak peek of our customers' emotions. The software requires the user to have a profile to access the application. The user needs to grant permission for the application to access the device's camera and media. This application saves the user profile on the device and keeps the profile logged-in until a user logs out of the device manually. As soon as the user opens the application, the device's camera opens and captures his facial expressions. The ESV system will determine emotions and suggest the best-recommended videos that may fit their current mood. The recommendations are according to user emotion and sentiment.
