# ESV
This project's actual concept is to automatically suggest user-preferred videos based on emotion detection and sentiment analysis. In the existing system, users have to select the videos manually. Randomly played videos may not match the mood of the user. Users have to classify the videos into various emotions for playing the videos. By using the ESV system, these difficulties can no longer take place. The ESV system will use a deep learning technique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for emotion detection. CNN is used to solve classification or identification problems.
